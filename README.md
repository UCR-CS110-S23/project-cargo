# Cargo
Cargo is a web application that allows users to rent out their cars,
similar to Airbnb. There are two types of users - renters and hosts.
All users are renters, but not all users are hosts. In order to be a 
host you must add your own car to be available for rent. Users can leave
comments and a rating (1-5 stars) on cars that are owned by other users. 

## Features

### Running admin panel
Inside front-end root dir, run
```sh
npm run build
```
move the built files to back-end public/ folder.
```sh
npm start
```

### Running instance on server
```sh
npm install
npm install pm2 -g
pm2 start bin/www --name cargo-admin -f
```
To restart the instance
```sh

pm2 start bin/www --name cargo-admin -f
```
